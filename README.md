We came up with a thought of building a website for the people, the young people, concentrating to the youth of our country. Knowing the power of the youth of the world, Youth can be bring the maximum changes in
the society. About 55% of our country’s population is of young people and in the era of various and different upcoming technologies, the young people are getting used to the phone and all other electronic devices 
and spending most of their time with them and wasting most of the time on entertainment purpose, using social media is not a problem, Spending almost whole day just holding your phones and scrolling Application 
like Tiktok is waste of time, and many more example can be mentioned but no need to mention them. These types of applications have washed their minds to see content in seconds and not to “Read” about anything to 
gain knowledge, due to this young people’s time and energy both are getting wasted. So we tried to make a website for the people which they find interesting and be curious about different topics, and tried to and 
provide the best and exact information about the topics in an impressive manner to build curious in their minds. P ROJECT REPORTtransform cultural and social institutions, concepts, and rules,which will inevitably
impact society for the long-haul. Thesechanges and transformations are not necessarily good or bad,but they are profound. On the surface, we may not notice social change; it can take years, even centuries of 
action to cause one change.As students and members of a rapidly changing society, it’simportant to look back on social changes of the past and howthey’ve influenced us now. Therefore, we made this website
which will serve by provide knowledge and information butvalues and ethics too.
In these recent times, Everyone is in the hurry of doing things
and need fast outcomes in their lifes. Everybody wants to be the
best but not even try to be the better version of themselves As
everyone wants the quicker outcomes and fast technology to
learn more in less amount of time to gather more information
and it is not possible to read everything in a second. To get
whole knowledge about any topic in seconds is impossible, So
to give information in precise form we created this website
which will give short but ample amount of information to
gather knowledge about any topic.
We created the ASK Website which itself refers to Always seek
knowledge. We tried to give precise information providing
enough knowledge to learn about things. We picked the topics
which provide vast knowledge and was beneficial for the future
uses, For example-Technologies. We picked different topics
with the most people interest and useful information. Tried to
make the audience engaged with the content and to deliver
information in a new way.
We used in total around 5 programming languages to build this
website which are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. We used Html
to make the basic structure of the website, Css for making it
look more attractive and Java to add functionality to the
webpages. React and concept of core ReactJs to add more of
these things and Ruby and Ruby on rail for the backend
purposes.
The website ASK (Always seek knowledge) provides the best
form of information, it focuses on giving specific information
on the given topic, it gives only information that is needed, no
excessive paragraphs. To gain good knowledge about any topic
Browser like Google and Yahoo gives thousands of article on
the relative search. Don’t you get confuse which link to click
on and which website to open, which website will give you the
information that you need. There are numerous website
available on the internet now, to learn about any firm you have
to read a lot but what to do different websites gives different
news/info, don’t you feel like their should be a website which
gives answer to all my question or to satisfy my curiosity.
