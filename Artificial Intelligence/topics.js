Here the machine is thought how to think or react according to the conditions. As it is the superset of machine learning and data science. The term AI is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks like thinking, visualizing, processing over an data and many more thing. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. Although a critical thinking has been developed in computers to match humans intellectual. AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic top-down approach, and the connectionist bottom-up approach.<br><br> The current suggested languages for AI due to their huge libraries are:-<br>1.Phyton <br> 2.LISP <br> 3.Javascript<br><br> Here are platforms for learning and executing AI logic:-<br>1.Google cloud AI<br>2.Microsoft Azure AI <br>3.H20.ai.";

Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. here the machine has been made capable to study the historic data and make the decision depending on the conditions learning from the data. Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies. There are different type of machine learning like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.For.ex. the self driven car of tesla has used the dojo the neural network of ML.<br><br>Here are the tool that are used for ML learning and development:-<br>1.Scikit Learn<br>2.tensorflow<br>3.Theano<br>4.Caffe<br>5.MxNet<br>6.
