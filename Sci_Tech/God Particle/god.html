        <p class="paragraph">The Higgs boson is the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that gives mass to other fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks. A particle’s mass determines how much it resists changing its speed or position when
            it encounters a force. Not all fundamental particles have mass. The photon, which is the particle of light and carries the electromagnetic force, has no mass at all. The Higgs boson was proposed in 1964 by Peter Higgs, François Englert, and
            four other theorists to explain why certain particles have mass. Scientists are now studying the characteristic properties of the Higgs boson to determine if it precisely matches the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics. If
            the Higgs boson deviates from the model, it may provide clues to new particles that only interact with other Standard Model particles through the Higgs boson and thereby lead to new scientific discoveries. The Higgs boson gets its mass just
            like other particles—from its own interactions with the Higgs field. There may be more than one Higgs boson. One theoretical model of new physics predicts five Higgs bosons. While the Higgs boson gives mass to the quarks that make up a proton,
            it is only responsible for giving a proton about 10% of its mass. The other 90% of a proton’s mass comes from the complex interactions of the quarks and the strong nuclear force. Since the Higgs boson has the role to generate the mass of other
            particles and the fact that dark matter can primarily be detected through its mass, the Higgs boson can be a unique portal to finding signs of dark matter.</p><br>
