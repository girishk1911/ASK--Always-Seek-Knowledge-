        <p class="paragraph">The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice.
            "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Global warming is the greatest existential challenge of our age, requiring massive
            societal changes to mitigate and adapt to it. Time is fast running out to do that. Hear what we must do to create a sustainable future and about the science and technology enabling it to happen. New Scientist’s Creating a Sustainable Future
            event is for everyone who cares about the planet and humanity’s future. Climate change is the most critical and controversial issue facing the world in the twenty-first century.  In 2100 our grandchildren will charge their phones using the
            power of a star and the phone chargers they use may be powered by fusion energy. Fusion can provide an abundant, carbon-free, safe and reliable source of energy but the challenges to get their are significant. This talk will demonstrate how
            the exciting fusion science and engineering in the world can help us all to pull together for a sustainable fusion future tomorrow. In the transition to zero carbon energy to deliver international climate goals, the key energy sources will
            be renewable resources that produce electricity directly rather than via heat engines. Most importantly, this transition will allow for large increases in the efficiency of energy use, which itself will make a major contribution to climate
            change mitigation. Agriculture fuels the food system; however some practices have led to soil degradation, reducing its growth potential and making land vulnerable to extreme weather. aiming to eliminate at least 3 million tons of greenhouse
            gas emissions. But this means they only have nine harvests to use the latest scientific developments and close partnership with farmers to take action to restore our Earth. We'll need technologies each of us won't like ("oh no, no that one!")
            and we'll need to hack the atmopshere, actively removing <br><br>
