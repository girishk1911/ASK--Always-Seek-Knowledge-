        <p class="paragraph"><strong>A</strong> superintelligence is an intelligence system that rapidly increases its intelligence in a short time, specifically, to surpass the cognitive capability of the average human being.
            <br> SUPERINTELLIGENCE or Artificial General Intelligence is the most advanced form of Artificial Intelligence, which is capable of exceeding the level of human biological intelligence. It will be capable of doing the things which humans canâ€™t
            even imagine, even without his control. The term implies intelligence that exceeds humans in a comprehensive way as opposed to a single ability such as mathematics and logic.We can tentatively define a superintelligence as any intellect that
            greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest. This would prove especially true if the AI could redesign its own cognitive architecture, engineer and fabricate new robotics tools and absorb more computing
            power. Many philosophers have expressed concern that such an entity might lack moral common sense and could be a threat to humanity.
