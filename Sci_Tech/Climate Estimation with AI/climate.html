        <p class="paragraph">We have entered the 21st century flooded by a vast sea of scientific literature: our Zeitgeist is to read and understand-daily-hundreds of scientific results; definitely a superhuman task. For this reason, machines are scientists’ best helpers:
            the posthuman era is here. To assess how the climate is changing and the impact of climate change, climatologists need to consult hundreds of thousands of peer-reviewed research papers spanning a wide range of disciplines-glaciology, biology,
            sea-level studies, geology, atmospheric studies, agricultural science. climatologists used a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify and classify studies
            covering a broad range of climate change impacts-”from glaciology to agricultural science; from marine biology to migration and conflict.” Callaghan and collaborators combined climate model simulations and observed data sets in publications
            about temperature from 1951 to 2018 and precipitation from 1951 to 2016 to identify trends attributable to humans. They found robust evidence of anthropogenic climate change impact on 48% of the global land areas, hosting 74% of the global
            population. Based on their artificial intelligence models, they inferred that human-influenced climate change affects 80% of the populated areas-where 85% of the population lives. It is worth noting that this new survey mapped articles in
            which the authors explicitly linked climate change to human influence, already taken into account by the IPCC, adding other “relevant studies” where the authors do not explicitly attribute impact variables to human influence.</p><br>
