        <p class="paragraph">Dark matter is stuff in space that has gravity, but it is unlike anything scientists have ever seen before. Together, dark matter and dark energy make up 95% of the universe. That only leaves a small 5% for all the matter and energy we know and
            understand. Dark matter is a hypothetical invisible mass thought to be responsible for adding gravity to galaxies and other bodies. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the
            universe. Dark matter is called dark because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect. Since the amount of
            visible material in galaxies can't account for their shapes, distributions, and movements, astrophysicists argue there must be a form of mass yet to be discovered. This mass doesn't appear to affect normal matter significantly in any other
            way - such as by absorbing or emitting photons - making it completely 'dark'. In spite of having so little to go on, researchers have continued to narrow down the characteristics of that 'missing matter' and have a few ideas what it might
            be. If it exists, it would make up 85 percent of the Universe's total material and roughly 25 percent of its energy <br><br>
