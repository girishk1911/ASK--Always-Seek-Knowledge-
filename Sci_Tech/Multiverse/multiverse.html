        <p class="paragraph">Multiverse theory suggests that our universe, with all its hundreds of billions of galaxies and almost countless stars, spanning tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only one. Instead, there may be an entirely different universe, distantly
            separated from ours — and another, and another. Indeed, there may be an infinity of universes, all with their own laws of physics, their own collections of stars and galaxies (if stars and galaxies can exist in those universes), and maybe
            even their own intelligent civilizations. It could be that our universe is just one member of a much grander, much larger multitude of universes: a multiverse. The concept of the multiverse arises in a few areas of physics (and philosophy),
            but the most prominent example comes from something called inflation theory. Inflation theory describes a hypothetical event that occurred when our universe was very young — less than a second old. In an incredibly brief amount of time, the
            universe underwent a period of rapid expansion, "inflating" to become many orders of magnitude larger than its previous size, according to NASA. In this eternal inflation scenario, each universe would emerge with its own laws of physics, its
            own collection of particles, its own arrangement of forces and its own values of fundamental constants. In this eternal inflation scenario, each universe would emerge with its own laws of physics, its own collection of particles, its own arrangement
            of forces and its own values of fundamental constants. In other words, so many things had to line up just right in our universe that the existence of life seems improbable. And if there was only one universe, it likely shouldn’t have life
            in it. But in a multiverse, there are enough “chances” for life to appear in at least one universe. But this theory is not especially compelling, so most scientists remain skeptical of the multiverse idea. "The multiverse offers one explanation
            for why all these features are favorable in our universe, which is that other universes exist as well, but we observe this one because it's capable of supporting complex life."</p><br>
