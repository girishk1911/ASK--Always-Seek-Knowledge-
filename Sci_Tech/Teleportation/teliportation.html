        <p class="paragraph">Teleportation is the hypothetical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them or Teleportation is the transfer of physical objects from one place to another, distant place, without
            transferring the physical particles that constitute the original object. Teleportation is the name given by science fiction writers to the feat of making an object or person disintegrate in one place while a perfect replica appears somewhere
            else. How this is accomplished is usually not explained in detail, but the general idea seems to be that the original object is scanned in such a way as to extract all the information from it, then this information is transmitted to the receiving
            location and used to construct the replica, not necessarily from the actual material of the original, but perhaps from atoms of the same kinds, arranged in exactly the same pattern as the original. Quantum teleportation is closely related
            to entanglement of quantum systems. It may be defined as a process by which a qubit (the basic unit of quantum information) can be transmitted from one location to another, without the qubit actually being transmitted through space. It is
            useful for quantum information processing and quantum communication. As with entanglement, it is applicable to simple and more complex quantum systems such as atoms and molecules. Recent research demonstrated quantum teleportation between
            atomic systems over long distances.</p><br>
